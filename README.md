# Origami React App

## 🧶 The Project

➡️ ➡️ [GO TO WEBSITE PROJECT]() ⬅️ ⬅️

I love crafting, journaling, making origamis, with this project I can combine both my passion of coding and practice my coding skills and share origamis pictures.
This project was also a way to play with svg animation.

### 👟 Steps

- Watched some SVG animations projects on Youtube
- Created the origami on Figma from scratch
- Built another origami to recreate the flying bird animation
- Designed the overall design of the website using mock data
- Fix animation issues
- Mapped through data to display the different origami
- Filtered image
- Created an active categorie for the li
- Added the change flying origami color options

## 📱 Media Queries

- `@media screen and (min-width: 320px)`
- `@media screen and (min-width: 400px)`
- `@media screen and (min-width: 600px)`
- `@media screen and (min-width: 768px)`
- `@media screen and (min-width: 960px)`
- `@media screen and (min-width: 1440px)`

## 🌵 Challenges

- First time using SVG, some SVG parameters such as Viewbox can't be used on CSS or Javascript, so to update the size of the origami, I had to use transform: scale(..) on CSS
- SVG difficult to manipulate expecially for complex animation: Animate can't be manipulated on JS or CSS.
- Designing the SVG on Figma

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
